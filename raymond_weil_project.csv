This timepiece of choice is available in several variations. The face comes in combinations of black roman numerals on a crisp white dial or alternating gold & diamond indexes on a mother-of-pearl face. The sapphire crystal window is framed by a beveled rectangular case. The tiered design gives this watch an illusion of depth without thickness. The watch is completed with RW monogram signature upon the crown. Unlike the classic round ladies’ toccata, this watch manages to nail a refined, retro aesthetic all the while remaining true to the Swiss craftsmanship and inspiration behind the collection.

RAYMOND WEIL introduces this design in the form of our ever-classic and popular ladies’ toccata collection.
This quartz model adopts a sophisticated art deco appeal with an elongated rectangular face and slim 6.25 mm case. This is our shallowest case design to date which gives a very sleek profile to this watch.
This timepiece of choice is available in several variations. The face comes in combinations of black roman numerals on a crisp white dial or alternating gold & diamond indexes on a mother-of-pearl face.
The sapphire crystal window is framed by a beveled rectangular case. The tiered design gives this watch an illusion of depth without the thickness. The watch is completed with RW logo signature upon the crown.
Unlike the classic round ladies’ toccata, this watch manages to nail a refined, retro aesthetic all the while remaining true to the Swiss craftsmanship and inspiration behind the collection.

With limited availability worldwide, the timepiece pays homage to the iconic contemporary artist, a visionary whose profound influence continues to resonate throughout the worlds of art and culture.
The result is a remarkable fusion of raw neo-expressionism and traditional watchmaking precision, that brings Basquiat’s genius to the wrists of watch enthusiasts and art aficionados alike.
The new freelancer Basquiat Special Edition timepiece is a true collectors’ item showcasing Basquiat’s artwork on the exterior and the artistry of Swiss watchmaking within.
A color palette dominated by the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue has been set against a black background to ensure the legibility of all horological functions. At the heart of the dial sits the iconic ‘Pez Dispenser’, the crown-wearing dinosaur depicted in Basquiat’s famous painting of 1984. Positioned at 12 o’clock, the crown boasts a yellow Super-Luminova® embellishment, while the hour hands and indexes are dressed in white Super-LumiNova®, emitting a glow under dim light conditions.
The sleek black PVD pushers are emblazoned with Basquiat’s iconic symbols; the Copyright symbol on the Cancel/Reset pusher; the Dollar sign on the Start/Stop pusher and the artist’s signature crown motif on the screwed-down crown. The watch highlights a ceramic tachymeter bezel, designed for precise measurement, alongside a flange pulsometer scale calibrated for 30 pulsations.
The bi-compax chronograph recessed counters and skeleton discs carry artistic depth. Located at 9 o’clock, the forever turning seconds’ disc has been covered with a concentric spiral as a metaphor for Basquiat’s personal reflections and life’s complexity. Positioned opposite, the 30-minute jumping disc depicts three of his core painting themes of life, death, and humanity.
At the heart of this timepiece lies Basquiat’s unmistakable signature, merging seamlessly with the W-shaped oscillating weight, RAYMOND WEIL’s horological signature. The titanium case marries design and function, sized at 43.5mm diameter for comfortable wear. The watch houses the caliber RW5030 movement, a mechanical bi-compax chronograph with automatic winding offering a 56-hour power reserve.
The watch is supplied in a special box featuring the iconic yellow crown on its side. Opening the box reveals a bespoke logo plate and ‘Pez’ icon. The presentation box provides an artistic means of showcasing the masterpiece within.
By introducing this special edition watch, RAYMOND WEIL celebrates his spirit and ensures that creativity remains at the heart of the company’s culture.",Special Edition

The use of progressive shades of blue in the dial makes this watch a bewitching composition. At the base of it, just above 6 o’clock, a rectangular aperture reveals the date. Presented in white numerals sat atop a blue disc, the colour of the date disc matches the dial, upholding horological etiquette. A 24-hour track is presented on the dial flange and is used in conjunction with the GMT hand to indicate whether the ‘home time’ is day or night. Nocturnal hours are expressed using white numerals set against a blue background, while daytime hours are shown in blue against a white backdrop. A crescent shaped moon denotes the midnight hour. Barrel shaped hour and minute hands collaborate with applied indexes, denoting the ‘local time’. A darkly attired GMT hand, endowed with a prominent triangular red and white tip, succinctly displays the hour at home. A slender silver-toned central sweep seconds hand, fitted with a highly legible lollipop, completes the suite of hands displayed. Both the hands and indexes are treated with Super-LumiNova®, ensuring readability even in dim light.

Inspired by the open road and a customised motorbike crafted by the artisans of Meister Engineering, RAYMOND WEIL unveils the new freelancer bronze chronograph 7780. This new model is an eye-catching vintage-inspired watch. And, just in case your heart is racing at the thought of it, the timepiece comes with a highly useful pulsometer scale. The two-wheeled work of art inspired our Genevan watch brand to create a bronze timepiece equipped with a chronograph, the freelancer 7780.
The RAYMOND WEIL freelancer Bronze Chronograph 7780 is available in two variants, one with orange and red accents, limited to just 300 pieces, and the other with blue accents. This new chronograph is perfectly suited to free thinkers and creative individuals. This model encompasses a number of exquisite refinements.
On the brand’s customised motorbike, the name RAYMOND WEIL adorns the fuel tank and is depicted in rose gold foil. This provided the inspiration for the texture of the 43.5mm bronze case and the two counters gracing the dial. Likewise, the motorbike’s gradient-effect paint influenced the watch’s black smoked dial. This latter detail confers an interesting display with light tones at the centre of the dial that assume a darker shade near the edge. The tachymeter and pulsometer scales engraved on the motorcycle tank cap are replicated on the watch’s satin-finished ceramic bezel insert and flange, respectively. Even the freelancer’s rich brown calf leather strap has been inspired by the motorbike’s leather-clad seat. Clearly, the specification of the bespoke motorbike has provided a wealth of ideas for the brand’s new vintage-inspired watch.
The symmetrical bi-compax layout features a 30-minute chronograph counter and a small seconds display. The golden hour and minute hands are generously proportioned and, in conjunction with the applied indexes, prove highly legible. The hour track is snailed, while the hands and indexes feature luminescent treatment, augmenting readability in restricted light. The colour of the central chronograph seconds hand, the hand on the 30-minute register and the numerals on the pulsometer scale are all presented in the same shade.
A date display is positioned at 6 o’clock, once again contributing to the overall symmetry of the dial. The date disc is presented in black, matching the colour of the dial, a detail much appreciated by purists.The tachymeter scale, presented on the bezel, provides the means to determine the speed of a motorbike, or vehicle of your choice, over a known distance. Residing on a bronze-toned flange, a pulsometer scale allows the wearer to determine the heart rate of an individual. A notable characteristic of this dial is that it wonderfully plays with shades, depths and textures, contributing to the watch’s sophisticated appearance.
With time, the bronze will mature and form a patina, heightening the overall sense of elegance. To the rear of the watch, the case back is presented in stainless steel. The movement, the Calibre RW5030, is visible via the exhibition case back. Once again, the attention to detail is clear to see. For example, the watch is fitted with a W-shaped skeleton oscillating weight, a reference to the founder’s surname. A further attribute of this automatic movement is that, assuming the mainspring is fully wound, the watch will run autonomously for 56 hours. As stated earlier, the watch comes on a brown calf leather strap. It is enlivened with contrasting stitching and paired with a bronze folding clasp equipped with a double push-security system.",
